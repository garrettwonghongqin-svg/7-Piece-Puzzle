# 7-Piece-Puzzle

Description:
This Python project implements a classic 7-piece sliding puzzle (also known as an 8-tile puzzle) featuring a 3×3 grid with one empty gap. The program initializes the board, handles tile movement based on user input, checks for valid slides into the empty space, and updates the puzzle state in real time. The code also includes goal-state detection to determine when the puzzle is solved, making it suitable for experimenting with basic game logic, search algorithms, or graphical extensions. This project provides a clear and modular foundation for understanding puzzle mechanics, state representation, and interactive command-line gameplay in Python.
